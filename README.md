b. List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both <br>
c. Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton <br>
d. Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton</p> <hr>


<b>Practical No. 4 : </b>
<p>Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using:<br>
a) Selection Sort <br>
b) Bubble sort and display top five scores. 
</p> <hr>


<b>Practical No. 5 : </b>
<p>Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using quick sort and display top five
scores.</p> <hr>


<b>Practical No. 6 : </b>
<p>a) Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student in array who attended training program in random order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended training program
or not, using Linear search and Sentinel search. <br>
b) Write a Python program to store roll numbers of student array who attended training program in sorted order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended training program or not, using Binary
search and Fibonacci search.</p> <hr>


<b>Practical No. 7 : </b>
<p>Second year Computer Engineering class, set A of students like Vanilla Ice-cream and set B of students like butterscotch icecream. Write C++ program to store two sets using linked list.
Compute and display- <br>
Set of students who like both vanilla and butterscotch <br>
Set of students who like either vanilla or butterscotch or not both <br>
Number of students who like neither vanilla nor butterscotch.</p><hr>

<b>Practical No. 8 : </b>
<p>The ticket booking system of Cinemax Theater has to be implemented using C++ program. There are 10 rows and 7 seats in each row. Doubly circular linked list has to be maintained to keep track of free seats at rows. Assume some random booking to 
start with. Use array to store pointers (Head pointer) to each row. On demand <br>
The list of available seats is to be displayed <br>
The seats are to be booked <br>
The booking can be cancelled.</p><hr>

<b>Practical No. 9 : </b>
<p>Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to postfix and its evaluation using stack based on given conditions: <br>
a) Operands and operator, both must be single character. <br>
b) Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format. <br>
Only '+', '-', '*' and '/ ' operators are expected.</p> <hr>

<b>Practical No. 10 : </b>
<p>In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as (),{},[]. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well Parenthesized or not.</p><hr>

<b>Practical No. 11 : </b>
<p>Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++ program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and  delete job from queue.</p> <hr>

<b>Practical No. 12 : </b>
<p>Double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be made at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a one- dimensional array. Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and delete elements from either end of the deque</p> <hr>

<b>Practical No. 13 : </b>
<p>Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served in 
first come first served basis. Order once placed cannot be 
cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system using 
circular queue using array.</p>
